PROGRAMS
1. Implement and demonstratethe FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific
hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a
.CSV file. 
2. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and
demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithmto output a description of the set
of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.
3. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3
algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this
knowledge toclassify a new sample. 
5. Write a program to implement the naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training
data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few
test data sets.
6. Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naïve Bayesian
Classifier model to perform this task. Built-in Java classes/API can be used to write
the program. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set.
9. Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris
data set. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can
be used for this problem.
